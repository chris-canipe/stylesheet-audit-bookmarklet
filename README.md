# Description

This little fellow takes a gander at the current web page's stylesheets and logs their sources, number of rules, and number of selectors to the console. 
A proactive alert box will let you know if the number of selectors meets or exceeds Internet Explorer's limit of 4,095 (for versions &le; 9).

For more information see [stylesheet limitations in Internet Explorer](http://blogs.msdn.com/b/ieinternals/archive/2011/05/14/internet-explorer-stylesheet-rule-selector-import-sheet-limit-maximum.aspx) and [this page](http://demos.telerik.com/testcases/4095issues.html) &mdash; a useful test for maxing out selectors.
